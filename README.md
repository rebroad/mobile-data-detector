# Mobile Data Detector

A simple, reliable system to detect when your Android device is using mobile data vs WiFi and apply intelligent bandwidth throttling based on your remaining data allowance. Supports multiple carriers with Three UK as the default.

## How It Works

The detector uses **public IP analysis** - the most reliable method to determine if you're using mobile data:

1. **Gets your public IP address** from multiple services (ifconfig.me, icanhazip.com, etc.)
2. **Resolves the hostname** for that IP address using reverse DNS
3. **Checks if the hostname contains mobile carrier domains** (configurable, Three UK by default)
4. **Applies bandwidth throttling** based on your remaining data allowance

This method is much more reliable than gateway detection or speed tests because:
- It directly identifies the carrier network you're connected to
- It works regardless of your phone's internal gateway configuration
- It doesn't waste bandwidth with speed tests
- It's the same method used by websites to detect your location/carrier

## Features

- ✅ **Reliable detection** using public IP analysis
- ✅ **Bandwidth tracking** - monitors your actual data usage
- ✅ **Intelligent throttling** - reduces speed based on remaining allowance
- ✅ **No process killing** - just throttles bandwidth
- ✅ **Desktop notifications** - informs you of connection changes
- ✅ **Usage statistics** - track daily and monthly usage
- ✅ **Automatic operation** - runs as a system service

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the files** to your system
2. **Run the installation script:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

The script will:
- Install required packages (python3, requests, tc, iproute2)
- Copy the detector to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Create a systemd service
- Set up log rotation
- Create user-friendly commands
- Start the service automatically

## Usage

### Commands

- `mobile-status` - Show service status and current detection results
- `mobile-test` - Run a manual detection test
- `mobile-usage` - Show detailed usage statistics

### Service Management

```bash
# Start/stop/restart the service
sudo systemctl start mobile-detector.service
sudo systemctl stop mobile-detector.service
sudo systemctl restart mobile-detector.service

# Enable/disable auto-start
sudo systemctl enable mobile-detector.service
sudo systemctl disable mobile-detector.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u mobile-detector.service -f
```

### Configuration

Edit `/etc/mobile_data_monitor.conf` to customize:

```bash
# Detection settings
DETECTION_INTERVAL=30          # Check every 30 seconds
BANDWIDTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=60    # Update usage every 60 seconds
MONTHLY_ALLOWANCE_GB=60        # Your monthly data allowance

# Android connection patterns
ANDROID_CONNECTIONS="Ed's iPhone,Android,Personal Hotspot,USB Tethering"

# Mobile carrier domains (comma-separated)
MOBILE_CARRIER_DOMAINS="threembb.co.uk,three.co.uk,three.com"

# Bandwidth throttling
ENABLE_THROTTLING=true
MIN_BANDWIDTH_MBPS=0.5         # Minimum speed (0.5 Mbps)
MAX_BANDWIDTH_MBPS=50          # Maximum speed (50 Mbps)
```

## How Throttling Works

When mobile data is detected, the system:

1. **Calculates remaining allowance percentage**
2. **Applies proportional throttling**:
   - 100% allowance remaining = no throttling
   - 50% allowance remaining = 50% of max speed
   - 25% allowance remaining = 25% of max speed
   - etc.

3. **Uses Linux Traffic Control (tc)** to limit bandwidth at the network interface level

## Configuring for Different Carriers

To use with a different mobile carrier, update the `MOBILE_CARRIER_DOMAINS` in your configuration file. Here are some common examples:

### Three UK (default)
```
MOBILE_CARRIER_DOMAINS="threembb.co.uk,three.co.uk,three.com"
```

### EE
```
MOBILE_CARRIER_DOMAINS="ee.co.uk,ee.com"
```

### O2
```
MOBILE_CARRIER_DOMAINS="o2.co.uk,o2.com"
```

### Vodafone
```
MOBILE_CARRIER_DOMAINS="vodafone.co.uk,vodafone.com"
```

### Verizon (US)
```
MOBILE_CARRIER_DOMAINS="verizon.com,verizonwireless.com"
```

### AT&T (US)
```
MOBILE_CARRIER_DOMAINS="att.com,att.net"
```

To find your carrier's domains, you can:
1. Connect to mobile data
2. Run `mobile-test` to see the detected hostname
3. Add the relevant domain patterns to your configuration

## Example Output

```
=== Three UK Mobile Data Detection Test ===

1. Public IP Analysis:
   Public IP: 92.40.217.174
   Hostname: 92.40.217.174.threembb.co.uk
   ✓ Three UK mobile data detected

2. Android Connection:
   ✓ Android connection detected

3. Overall Detection:
   Mobile data detected: True
   Remaining allowance: 85%
```

## Files

- `mobile_detector.py` - Main detection script
- `mobile-detector.service` - systemd service file
- `install.sh` - Installation script
- `README.md` - This file

## Troubleshooting

1. **Service not starting:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status mobile-detector.service
   sudo journalctl -u mobile-detector.service -n 50
   ```

2. **Detection not working:**
   ```bash
   mobile-test
   ```

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/mobile_detector.log
   ```

4. **Verify public IP manually:**
   ```bash
   curl ifconfig.me
   nslookup $(curl -s ifconfig.me)
   ```

## Why This Method Works

Mobile carriers assign specific IP ranges and hostnames to their networks. When you connect to Three UK's mobile data, your public IP will resolve to a hostname containing their domain (like `threembb.co.uk`). This is the same method used by:

- Streaming services to detect your location
- Websites to show region-specific content
- CDNs to route traffic efficiently

It's much more reliable than trying to detect gateway IPs or measure network characteristics, which can vary significantly.
